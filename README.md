# FontChanger_bot

This is the full code for a Telegram bot that helps people change their texts into beautiful fonts without leaving the Telegram app. The bot was written in Python using the aiogram framework.

The bot provides a simple way for Telegram users to apply different fonts to their text messages. It supports a wide range of font styles, including <b><i>`bold, dark bubbles, semibold, squares, sky blue, serif, fraktur`</i></b> and many more. Users can choose the font style they want. The bot will respond with the same message, but with the requested font style applied.

## How to run the bot locally

To run the bot on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Create a `.env` file using the `.env.dist` file as a template. Fill in the required environment variables with your own values.
3. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the `app.py` file using Python 3.

##### Once the bot is running, you can interact with it on Telegram.
